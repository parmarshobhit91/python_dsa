GRAPHS 
Graphs consist of two things. A set of V(vertex) of elements called nodes.
and A set of e of edges such that each edge e in E is identified with a unique 
(unordered) pair[u, v] of nodes in V, denoted by e = [u,v]

v indicates parts of graph writing G = (V, E)

ADJACENT nodes
If e = [u, v], then u and v are called adjacent nodes or neighbour.

        where u and v are adjacent nodes/vertex and e is edge


DEGREE OF NODE
The degree of node u written as deg(u), is the number of edges containing u.
If deg(u) = 0, then the node is isolated node

PATH
A path of length l from a node u to a node v is defined as sequence of n+1 node.

A path is said to be closed if first node/vertex and last node/vertex are same.

SIMPLE AND COMPLEX PATH
A path is said to be simple if all the nodes are distinct with the exception that v0 may equal to vn otherwise
it is a complex path.


CONNECTED GRAPH
A graph is said to be connected if there is a path between any of its two nodes.

TREE GRAPH
A connected graph T without any cycles is called tree graph or free tree or simply a tree.
This means in particular that there is a unique simple path p between any two nodes u and v.

MULTI GRAPH
A multi graph is a graph consist of multiple edges and loop.

LABELLED GRAPH
A graph is to be labelled if its edges are assigned data.

WEIGHTED GRAPH
A graph G is said to be weighted if each edge e in graph G is assigned a non negative numerical value W(e) called weight
or length of edge.

MULTIPLE EDGES
A distinct edges e and f are called multiple edges if they connect the same end point i.e., if e = [u, v] and f =[u, v]

LOOP
An edge is called loop if it has identical end points.

DIRECT GRAPHS
A directed graph G is also called diagraph is same as multi graph except that each edge is assigned a direction.

COMPLETE GRAPH
A simple graph in which there exist an edge between every pair of vertices is called complete graph. It is also known as
Universal graph.
